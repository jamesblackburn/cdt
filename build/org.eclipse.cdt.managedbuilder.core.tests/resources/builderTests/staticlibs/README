The Graph between these projects, looks like this:

App;Release:
#Reachable-Configs:
# Lib1:Release [cdt.managedbuild.config.gnu.lib.release.598138734]
# Lib3:Release [cdt.managedbuild.config.gnu.lib.release.590234840]
# Lib2:Release [cdt.managedbuild.config.gnu.lib.release.763005992]
# Lib4:Release [cdt.managedbuild.config.gnu.lib.release.990683005]


digraph {
"App:Release" -> "Lib1:Release"
  "Lib1:Release" -> "Lib3:Release"
"App:Release" -> "Lib2:Release"
  "Lib2:Release" -> "Lib3:Release"
  "Lib2:Release" -> "Lib4:Release"
"App:Release" -> "Lib3:Release"
"App:Release" -> "Lib4:Release"
}

*NB* the .projects just have normal eclipse level project references.
It therefore also tests that we correctly handle old-style CDT project references
before build configurations were moved to the platform.
